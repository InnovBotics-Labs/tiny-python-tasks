Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:

Objective
The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.

Card Values
1. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
2. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
3. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

The Deal
1. Each player is dealt two cards, face up.
2. The dealer is also dealt two cards, typically one face up (the up card) and one face down (the hole card).

Player's Turn

Players can choose to:
1. Hit: Take another card from the dealer.
2. Stand: Keep their current hand and end their turn.
3. Double Down: Double their initial bet and take exactly one more card. (# NOT IMPLEMENTED: Future enhancements)
4. Split: If the first two cards have the same value, players can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet. (# NOT IMPLEMENTED: Future enhancements)
5. Surrender: Forfeit half their bet and end their hand immediately (not allowed in all games). (# NOT IMPLEMENTED: Future enhancements)

Dealer's Turn

1. The dealer reveals their hole card.
2. The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher. In some variations, a dealer must hit on a "soft" 17 (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).

Winning
1. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet.
2. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
3. If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, the player wins and is paid out 1:1 on their bet.
4. If a player has a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) and the dealer does not, the player is usually paid out 3:2 on their bet.
5. If both the player and dealer have hands of equal value, it's a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.

Additional Rules
1. Insurance: If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, players can place an insurance bet, up to half their original bet, against the dealer having a Blackjack. If the dealer has Blackjack, the insurance bet pays 2:1.
2. Side Bets: Some variations of Blackjack offer side bets, such as betting on pairs or specific card combinations.
