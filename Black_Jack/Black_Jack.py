# ------------------ Blackjack House Rules ---------------------------

# The deck is unlimited in size.
# There are no jokers.
# The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# The computer is the dealer.

# -------------------- Wining Terms ---------------------
# 1. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet.
# 2. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
# 3. If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, the player wins and is paid out 1:1 on their bet.
# 4. If a player has a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) and the dealer does not, the player wins.
# 5. If both the player and dealer have hands of equal value, it's a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
